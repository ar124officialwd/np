# Contributing

Any kind of contribution is welcome.

## Guidelines

1. **Project Oriented Development (POD)**: POD cannot be sacrificed under any
   condition. Contributions that pollute the user's home directory or OS will
   not be merged. All configurations must remain project-specific and isolated.

2. **Keybindings**: Keys must be grouped logically, prioritizing usability over
   traditional conventions. This may or may not align with standard traditions.
